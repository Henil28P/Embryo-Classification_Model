# EmbryoClassificationModel
An AI classification model to classify different Embryo from dataset.

In this project , we are stepping into the domain where artificial intelligence intertwines with reproductive science to foster better outcomes in embryo selection.
Our project is materialized through the "Hung Vuong Hospital Embryo Classification" dataset, a rich source of data aimed at using machine learning for embryo quality classification.
This dataset is organised into training and testing sets, encompassing images of embryos at critical developmental stages - day-3 and day-5.
The training folder is a comprised of embryonic images intended for honing our model, while the test folder holds unseen data, used to evaluate our modelâ€™s prowess in real-world scenarios.
Essential to our analysis is a file structure that encapsulates the essential details of each embryonic image, segregated into 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'. These files are our roadmap to understanding the inherent characteristics of the data, thus, paving the path for a well-informed modelling process.
Now, for our model development , we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a sterling algorithm known for its efficacy in image recognition tasks.
Using CNN we aim on building a robust model capable of discerning the quality of embryos with high precision. The benefits of this algorithm it that it delves deep into the intricacies of embryonic images, identifying patterns that are emblematic of 'good' or 'not good' classifications.

**Goal:**
Our objective is marked by a straightforward yet impactful objective: to accurately classify embryo images as '1' for good or '0' for not good, for both day-3 and day-5 stages. This classification is not just a binary outcome; it's a leap towards enhancing the success rates of in-vitro fertilization procedures, potentially bringing joy to countless families.
Our success metric is straightforward: achieve a high accuracy rate in classifying the test set, thereby demonstrating the model's aptitude in navigating the nuanced landscape of embryo quality assessment.
As we embark on this innovative journey, the fusion of artificial intelligence and reproductive science holds the promise of igniting a new era of medical advancements, making strides towards a future where technology serves at the forefront of nurturing life.
